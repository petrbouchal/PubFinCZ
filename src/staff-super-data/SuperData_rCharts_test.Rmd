``` {r Knitr prep, cache=FALSE,include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, dev='cairo_pdf', warning=FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(rCharts)
library(dplyr)
source('./src/lib/lib_PubFinCZ_light.R')
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
